DESCRIPTION:
uptodate helps you to keep your system uptodate

uptodate can tell you when a new version of a program is avaible. To
do that, you have to add a module. Lets try with zope :

   uptodate add zope \
      http://www.zope.org/Products/ \
      'Download Zope (.{1,10})\s*</a>' \
      A leading open source application server

uptodate add command takes three arguments:
 + a name
 + url where it will search version
 + a regular expression to locate version in the text
 + an optional comment

Future release will try to find the regular expression for you.

You can now check for new versions with

   uptodate check zope

it will display something like

   zope: '2.7.4' removed.
   zope: '2.7.5' added.

if versions found in the text have changed.

To keep your programs uptodate, add them to uptodate, and add the
following line in your crontab (crontab -e) to check version each
night:

    01 20 * * * uptodate check -aA

You will receive an email when a new version will be avaible.

uptodate let you use more command than add and check. Try 

	 uptodate --help

to have details
