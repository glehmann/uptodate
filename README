DESCRIPTION:
uptodate helps you to keep your system uptodate

uptodate can tell you when a new version of a program is avaible. To
do that, you have to add a module. Lets try with zope :

   uptodate add zope \
      http://www.zope.org/Products/ \
      2.7.4 \
      A leading open source application server
   
 uptodate add --auto command takes three arguments:
 + a name
 + url where it will search version
 + the current version number
 + an optional comment

uptodate add --auto try to find a regular expression which will be used
to find new versions. If uptodate add --auto can't find a regular
expression, or if the regular expression isn't good enough for you, you
can use uptodate add :

   uptodate add zope \
      http://www.zope.org/Products/ \
      'Download Zope (.{1,10})\s*</a>' \
      A leading open source application server
      
arguments are the same, but the third is regular expression instead of 
version.

You can now check for new versions with

   uptodate check zope

it will display something like

   zope: '2.7.4' removed.
   zope: '2.7.5' added.

if versions found in the text have changed.

To keep your programs uptodate, add them to uptodate, and add the
following line in your crontab (crontab -e) to check version each
night:

    01 20 * * * uptodate check -aA

You will receive an email when a new version will be avaible.

uptodate let you use more command than add and check. Try 

	 uptodate --help

to have details. uptodate supports bash completion, so you can also
use completion to remember avaible options, commands and modules.
