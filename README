DESCRIPTION:
uptodate allows you to trace the versions of everything which has a version

uptodate is powerful and user friendly command line tool which helps you to
know when a new version is available. It searches for new versions in a web
page, a ftp directory, etc, and shows you added and removed version since the
last search. If you update some softs by hand, if you are a package maintainer,
or if you simply want to know when the new version of your favorite game (or
everything else with a version) is out, uptodate is for you !

USAGE:
To be able to search for new versions, you must ask uptodate to add a
module to his config. For example, if you want to search zope's new
version, you can do:

   uptodate auto zope \
      http://www.zope.org/Products/ \
      2.7.4
   
uptodate auto try to find a regular expression which will be used
to find new versions. Most of the time, you don't need to find regular
expression; uptodate do it for you.
uptodate auto command need informations to find versions:
 + a name
 + the url where it will search version
 + the current version number

If uptodate auto can't find a regular expression, or if the regular
expression isn't good enough for you, you can use uptodate add :

   uptodate add zope \
      http://www.zope.org/Products/ \
      'Download Zope (.{1,10})\s*</a>'
      
arguments are the same, but the third is regular expression instead of 
version.

You can now check for new versions with

   uptodate check zope

it will display something like:

   zope: '2.7.4' removed.
   zope: '2.7.5' added.

if versions found in the text have changed.

To be automatically warned for new versions, add the following line in
your crontab (crontab -e):

    01 20 * * * uptodate check -aA

It will search new versions each nigth, and you will receive an email
if a new version is be avaible.

uptodate let you use more command than add and check. Try 

	 uptodate --help

to have details. It also supports bash completion, so you can use
"uptodate <tab>" or "uptodate command <tab>" to list avaible options,
commands and modules.
